#  A Comprehensive Measure of Well-Being: HDI Prediction System

##  Overview

The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistical measure developed by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to evaluate a country's level of human development.

This project predicts the Human Development category using Machine Learning based on four important indicators:

- Life Expectancy at Birth
- Expected Years of Schooling
- Mean Years of Schooling
- Gross National Income (GNI) per Capita

The prediction categories are:

- 🟢 Very High
- 🔵 High
- 🟡 Medium
- 🔴 Low
